The goal of this assignment was to create an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

### Steps Taken

#### Step 1 
- Created project environment by creating all necessary folders and files.

#### Step 2
- Ran npm init to install and initilize dependencies.

#### Step 3
- Connected database with mongoose for MongoDB interaction, and other utilities like dotenv for environment variables management.

#### Step 4
- Set up the Express server, including middleware for body parsing.

#### Step 5
- Created RESTful API routes in the /routes directory. Defined routes for handling CRUD operations for each resource and linked them to controller functions.

#### Step 6
